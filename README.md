📈 Chapter 1: What Is Forex Trading?
Forex trading is the process of buying one currency while selling another. It always involves currency pairs like EUR/USD, where EUR is the base currency, and USD is the quote.

🧠 Key Forex Terms Every Beginner Should Know:
Pip: The smallest price move (usually 0.0001).

Lot: A trade size unit (standard lot = 100,000 units).

Leverage: Allows control of large trades with small capital (e.g., 1:100).

Spread: The difference between buying (bid) and selling (ask) price.

Margin: Capital required to open a leveraged position.

🔑 Pro Tip: Understand these basics before opening a live trading account.

🌐 Chapter 2: How the Forex Market Works
Unlike stock markets, forex is decentralized, functioning through a network of global participants—banks, brokers, and individuals.

⏰ Major Forex Market Sessions:
Session	GMT Time	Key Features
Sydney	10 PM – 7 AM	Start of the trading day
Tokyo	12 AM – 9 AM	High activity on JPY pairs
London	8 AM – 5 PM	Most liquid session
New York	1 PM – 10 PM	Best overlap with London for volume

💡 Pro Tip: Trade during session overlaps (e.g., London–New York) for higher volatility and better opportunities.
